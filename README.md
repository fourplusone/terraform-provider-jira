## Install

## Terraform v0.13

Copy this code into yout terraform configuration file (for example `main.tf`)

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    jira = {
      source = "fourplusone/jira"
      version = "0.1.14"
    }
  }
}
```

Run `terraform init`

## Terraform v0.12 

* Download `terraform-provider-jira` binary from [Github](https://github.com/fourplusone/terraform-provider-jira/releases)
* Unzip the zip file
* Then move `terraform-provider-jira` binary to `$HOME/.terraform.d/plugins` directory

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.terraform.d/plugins
mv terraform-provider-jira $HOME/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform-provider-jira

```

* Run `terraform init` in your terraform project

```bash
terraform init
```

Used to initialize the plugin

## Example Usage

Set JIRA URL, Username and Password using environment variables

```bash
export JIRA_URL=http://localhost:8080
export JIRA_USER=username
export JIRA_PASSWORD=password
```

It's also possible to use an API-Token from JIRA cloud. In this case, set 

```bash
export JIRA_URL=https://yourinstance.atlassian.net
export JIRA_USER=username@example.org
export JIRA_PASSWORD=<API-Key>
```

Create terraform config file

```hcl

provider "jira" {
  url = "https://myjira.atlassian.net" # Can also be set using the JIRA_URL environment variable
  # user = "xxxx"                      # Can also be set using the JIRA_USER environment variable
  # password = "xxxx"                  # Can also be set using the JIRA_PASSWORD environment variable
}

Run `terraform init`

Initializing provider plugins...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

Run `terraform plan`

```bash
terraform plan
```

Check if the terraform plan looks good

Run `terraform apply`

```bash
terraform apply
```

## Building 

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine.

*Note:* This project uses [Go Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) making it safe to work with it outside of your existing [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH). The instructions that follow assume a directory in your home directory outside of the standard GOPATH (i.e `$HOME/development/terraform-providers/`).

Clone repository to: `$HOME/development/terraform-providers/`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $HOME/development/terraform-providers/; cd $HOME/development/terraform-providers/
$ git clone git@github.com:fourplusone/terraform-provider-jira
...
```

Enter the provider directory and run `make build` to build the provider

```sh
$ make build
```

## Rationale
Working in Operations engineering organizations infrastructure is often driven by tickets. Why not track infrastructure using tickets but this time we will use code.
This just showcases that you can pretty much Terraform anything!
