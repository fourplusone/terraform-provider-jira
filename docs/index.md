# JIRA Provider

Working in Operations engineering organizations infrastructure is often driven by tickets. 
Why not track infrastructure using tickets but this time we will use code. 

## Example Usage

Set JIRA URL, Username and Password using environment variables

```bash
export JIRA_URL=http://localhost:8080
export JIRA_USER=username
export JIRA_PASSWORD=password
```

If you prefer Personal Access Tokens

```bash
export JIRA_URL=http://localhost:8080
export JIRA_TOKEN=<Personal Access Token>
```


It's also possible to use an API-Token from JIRA cloud. In this case, set 

```bash
export JIRA_URL=https://yourinstance.atlassian.net
export JIRA_USER=username@example.org
export JIRA_PASSWORD=<API-Key>
```

```terraform
provider "jira" {
  url = "https://myjira.atlassian.net" # Can also be set using the JIRA_URL environment variable
  user = "xxxx"                      # Can also be set using the JIRA_USER environment variable
  password = "xxxx"                  # Can also be set using the JIRA_PASSWORD environment variable
  token = "xxxx"                      # Can also be set using the JIRA_TOKEN environment variable
}
```
